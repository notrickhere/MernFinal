        This is a small retail store located in North Western Massachusetts. We
        were funded back in 1903. We offer to buy used Items, and we mainly sell
        Coke, Pens and Deodorant. You must be wondering why do we specifically
        sell these 3 items? This is because through the test of time these are
        voted to be fan favorites! We also sell used items too!
